## QUEUES

- We join a queue whenever we get in line and then there's other people that can get in line behind us.
- First In First Out (FIFO)
- When we add people to the queue like this, we use the term in 'Enqueue'.
- When we remove people from the queue like this, we use the term 'Dequeue'.
- For something to be a queue, you add on one end in, you remove on the other end.
- With a list, Removing and adding from the end is O(1).
- But on the other end removing and adding is O(n).
- We enqueue and dequeue from different ends.
- In Queues, we're just going to call these first and last.
