
In the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), BST stands for Binary Search Tree. Traversal in BST (or any type of tree) refers to the process of visiting each node in the tree in a specific order. The different types of binary tree traversals include:

## Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right) : 
In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right subtree. If performed on a binary search tree, it visits the nodes in ascending order.

## Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right) : 
In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree. Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree or to get a prefix expression on of an expression tree.

## Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root) :
 In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, so the method first visits the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node. Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree or to get the postfix expression of an expression tree.

## Level Order Traversal (or Breadth-First Traversal): 
In this traversal method, the nodes are visited level by level. It starts from the root (or any arbitrary node) and visits nodes at a level before going to the next level.

These traversal methods are used based on the particular problem at hand. For example, inorder traversal of a BST will give the nodes in sorted order.
