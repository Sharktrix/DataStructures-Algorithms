Trees = A Data Structure which represents data in a hierarchy 

- Top Most Node = Root Node 
- Every Node has left and right node
- Nodes that dont have children are called Leafs
- A linked list is just a tree that doesn't form
- Nodes in a tree can be taken as dictonaries
- Each node can only point to two other nodes
- Full Tree = Every node has zero or 2 nodes
- Perfect Tree = Any level in the tree that has any 
nodes is completely filled all the way across.
- Full Tree = Every node has 2 nodes
- Complete Tree = We are filling the tree from left to right with no gap.
- Every node can only have one parent. 

- INSERT, REMOVE, SEARCH, DELETE

Choice of DSA depends on: 
- What needs to be stored?
- Cost of Operations
- Memory Consumption
- Ease of implementation
