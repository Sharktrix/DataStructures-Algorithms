G = ( V, E)
V = Vertices
E = Edges

Spanning Tree is a subgraph of a graph having all Vertices 
and Edges minus Vertices 

|Y| = n = 6 / Vertices
n - 1 = 5 / Edges

- Trees have no cycles or Loops
- S c G 
S = (V, E)
V (Graph) = V (Spanning Tree)
E = V - 1


- For a given graph, I can have multiple spanning trees equal to the number of edges.
- Formula : E C (V - 1) - no. of cycles


Weighted Graph 
- Cost = Sum of Weightage of Edges

* Minimum Spanning Tree = Trying all spanning trees to find the minimum spanning tree
- Two methods of finding the MST: 
- Both methods give the same solution but time taken differs.

** 1. Kruskal's Method
- Always select a minimum cause edge but if an edge is forming a cycle,
do not include it in the solution.
E = V - 1
O(V*E)
O(n.E) = O (n2) (square)



** 2. Prim's Method 
- Always take the min edge which should be connected to other nodes so we can form a tree.
Cost = Weight of all edges after Prim's method

- We can find prim's method if we don't have connected edges graph.
