Binary Search Tree : 
- In a Binary Search Tree, the nodes have to be laid out in a particular way.
- With a BST, when we add nodes, If the number is greater than the root node, 
its going to go on the right side of the node.
And if it's less than its going to on the left of that node.
- We're always going to start at the top node.

Big O 
- Level 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 
- O(logn) is achieved by doing divide and conquer.
- We start at the top, we either go right or left and remove the rest.
- This way we dont have to look at everything.
- For a tree thats not crooked O(n) = 
- The Big O if a BST is technicallt O(n) and NOT O(logn)
