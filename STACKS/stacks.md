- For something to be a stack, we just have to add and remove from the same end.
- But with a stack we're only adding and removing from the top, so we really don't need bottom.
- We might wanna use an end specifically where we need not index everything.
- LIFO - Last In First Out
- Favorite analogy for a stack is a can of tennis balls.
- Implementing a stack using a linked list. There's only one end I want to use for adding and removing. 0(1)
- Push and Pop are the terminology for adding and removing an item.
- Reindexing side of the list is O(n) / the opposite  end is O(1).
- What I don't want to do is implement a stack where the none terminated end is this way.
- Now with the link list, we had head and tail with a stack. We'll call this top and bottom.
