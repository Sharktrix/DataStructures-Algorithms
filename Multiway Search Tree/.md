## Multiway Search Trees
2-3 is a type of B-Tree, and it has concepts of 2-node and 3-nodes. 2-3 Tree is also called a B-Tree of order 3.
It keeps a secondary data structure stored at each node. Data is stored in sorted order in this D.S
It keeps the primary tree balanced
### 2-3 Trees
A height-balanced tree, offering O(log n ) operations (insert-delete-search)
Nodes contain 1 or 2 values
1 Value node (2-node):
Either a leaf node or
Has exactly two non-null children (values in left subtree < value in node < values in right subtree)
2 Value node (3-node): The values are in order from left to right (left < right)
Either a leaf node or
Has exactly 3 non-null children (values in left subtree < first value in node < values in middle subtree < second value in node < value in right subtree.)
2-nodes: Nodes with 2 children, they have 1 data value
      A
     / \
    L   R 
    
L< A < R
3-nodes: Nodes with 3 children, they have 2 data values
      A-B
     / | \
    L  M  R 
L< A < M < B < R
All leaf nodes are at the same level
Insertion is done at a leaf
### 2-3 Tree Operations
Split operation: splitting a node when number of value goes beyond 2
Move middle value to parent and split left and right values to two separate nodes
Repeat for parent if needed
Fusion/Merge operation: When a 3-node has two children;
Pull down left value from the node and merge it with the left child
or a leaf node has no value (only happens while deletion)

### Search
If empty, return False
If current node has data return false (we have to search the node, i.e., if left and right values present, compare with left and right)
Compare with the left and right values in the current node and decide to recurse on left or right node
If we reach leaf and did not find value return False
class Node(self, left_v, right_v, left_c, rigth_c, mid_c)
### Insertion
Scenario 1: Insert in a node with 1 value: No extra operation is needed
Scenario 2: Insert in a node with 2 values where the parent has 1 value
Create a temporary 3 value node
Split operation where the new parent is merged with the parent of the split node
Scenario 3: Insert in a node with 2 values where the parent also has two values
Create a temporary 3 value node
Split operation-Now the parent becomes a 3 value node
Perform split operation on the parent
### Deletion
Scenario 1: Simply delete - when deleting the value does not break 2-3
Scenario 2: When deletion cause the 2-node to have 2 children instead of 3: merge
